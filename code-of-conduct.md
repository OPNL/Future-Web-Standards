# Future Web Standards | The Futurist Web Covenant
**Also called the "Freedom Web Covenant" or the "Inventor's Covenant**\
*Version 1, #th Month YR*

## Inspiration
The rise of censorship has divided people apart and ruined the main purpose of what the internet was intended for. Outside of censorship, the internet as we know it have been controlled mostly by corporate giants, monopolies and centralized entities. The fear of a non-open internet is what lead to the development of the [decentralized internet](https://github.com/Lonero-Team/Decentralized-Internet), the blockchain, and numerous protocols prior. This is what will lay the foundation of the next generation's internet. Not only is this more open, but less outdated technological infrastructure is needed. Outside of this, the inspiration for this covenant if you will, is humanity. Seemingly, we are becoming more and more divided over issues that shouldn't exist in a modern world. Issues that intellectualism doesn't allow for, such as racism shouldn't exist. However, neither should censorship. It is better to allow hate to speak, so that hate is pointed out and rediculed. Giving any form of adequate excuse for a central authority on what one can and can not say is usually a slippery slope. I think a modern day *code of ethics* should be in place for what will aly the foundation for the current internet, and the next generation's internet. I feel like we have many prima facie moral duties in terms of where humanity is going, how technology should be, and pushing society ethically further as a whole. Hence, these standards are in order.
 
## Code of ethics
